# 🧠 DBCV: Density-Based Clustering Validation – A Visual Blog Post

Welcome to this educational blog post about **DBCV (Density-Based Clustering Validation)** — a powerful metric for evaluating density-based clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and HDBSCAN.

🧪 **Based on the paper:** ["Density-Based Clustering Validation" (Moulavi et al., SDM 2014)](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~zimek/publications/SDM2014/DBCV.pdf)

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- Why traditional validation metrics fail for non-convex clusters
- What DBCV is and how it works step-by-step
- Visual explanation of key concepts like:
  - Core distance
  - Mutual reachability distance
  - Density separation vs sparseness
- Hands-on clustering comparisons using:
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
  - HDBSCAN
